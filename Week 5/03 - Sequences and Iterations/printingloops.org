Using a for loop, write a function that prints all multiples of x within the
interval n ... m, each separated by ",".

This function takes a function, f, and applies f from 0 to m using a for loop.
The function prints "negative" if the result of f is strictly negative and 
"positive" if strictly positive. 
Each print statement appears on a newline.
Once f returns 0, it will print "zero". To do so, we will define an exception,
'raise' it inside the loop once the condition is met to break the loop, and then
catch the exception so we return the unit type, ().
