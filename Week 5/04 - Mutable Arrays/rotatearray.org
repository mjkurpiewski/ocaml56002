* Rotating the Contents of an Array
In this exercise, we will improve the code for rotating arrays, modifying
the existing rotate function and defining a function 'rotate_by' which allows
you to rotate by n positions.

let n = Array.length a in
let v = a.(0) in
for i = 0 to n - 2 do
  a.(i) <- a.(i+1)
done;
a.(n - 1) <- v;;
*** Perfect this!
** DONE rotate_by : 'a array -> int -> unit

This function adds an additional argument of (n : int) which rotates the
argument (a : 'a array) n places. For example:
rotate_by [|1;2;3;4|] 3 = [|4;1;2;3|]
*** let rotate_by a n =
