# 56002 - Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml

This repository contains the vast majority of the 
code produced as I completed Universit√© Paris Diderot's
MOOC on functional programming in OCaml. 

## Completion

Missing work for week 6 module on functors, partial 
solution given for the tree traversal exception problem
set. For the course I completed the Markov text generator
for the final project option. In the near future, I hope
to add the solution to the Klotski solver project, as 
well.
